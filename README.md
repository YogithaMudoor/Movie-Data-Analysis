# Movie-Data-Analysis


Problem Statement:
The goal of this analysis is to analyse the likes and dislikes of the audience or at least check how their preference signals (IMDB and rotten tomatoes ratings) are impacted by other dimensions of a movie.
1. Audience preference analysis - Analyse audience movie preference across different dimensions like rating system, genre, language, etc.
2. Movie earning potential analysis - Analyse movie earning based on audience movie preference and other dimensions like genre, year released etc.
